Project Explanation


Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines based on their demographics, behaviors, and opinions. The task is a multilabel classification problem where each respondent's probability of receiving each vaccine is predicted. The primary evaluation metric for this task is the ROC AUC score.


Data Description

The project uses three datasets:

- training_set_labels.csv: Contains respondent IDs with binary labels indicating whether they received the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines.
- train_set_features.csv: Includes various features for each respondent, such as demographic information, behavioral patterns, and opinions.
- test_set_features.csv: Similar to train_set_features.csv, but without the labels.
- submission_format.csv: Provides the format required for the final submission.


Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features:

- Missing Values: Imputed using the most frequent value for each feature.
- Categorical Encoding: Applied LabelEncoder to transform categorical variables into numeric form.
- Feature Scaling: Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler.


Model Development

The project utilizes a MultiOutputClassifier with a RandomForestClassifier base model. The multi-output approach allows simultaneous prediction of the probabilities for both target labels (xyz and seasonal vaccines).

- Splitting Data: The training data was split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Training: The RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle a mix of feature types. It was trained on the preprocessed training set.
- Validation: The model's performance was validated using the ROC AUC score, which measures the ability to distinguish between the classes.


Model Evaluation

The model's effectiveness was gauged by predicting the probabilities on the validation set and calculating the ROC AUC score for both target variables. The average of these scores provided a comprehensive performance metric.


Prediction and Submission

After validating the model, predictions were made on the test set. The probabilities of receiving the xyz and seasonal vaccines were calculated for each respondent. These predictions were formatted according to the submission_format.csv and saved as a submission file.


Results

The project's final output is a CSV file containing respondent IDs along with their predicted probabilities for receiving the xyz and seasonal vaccines. The submission file adheres to the required format, ensuring compatibility with the evaluation system.


Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a structured approach to solving a multilabel classification problem using machine learning techniques. By carefully preprocessing the data, employing a robust model, and validating the results, the project provides reliable predictions for the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal vaccines. The use of the ROC AUC score as the evaluation metric ensures that the model's performance is measured accurately, contributing to effective decision-making in public health interventions.
